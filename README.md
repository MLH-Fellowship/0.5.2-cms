# Connections
We believe that the connections made during an internship/fellowship/etc is the most valuable part of the experience, but it can also be difficult to maintainâ€”especially for global programs such as the MLH Fellowship. You may need to keep notes of things said during a 1-on-1 meeting, their typical availability (in your time zone), their preferred modes of communication, etc. It can be overwhelming. That is why Connections is here to serve as your one-stop shop for keeping track of it all.
